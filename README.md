Hello! My name is Knyght. 
I am 17 years old and in my Junior year in highschool. 
I live in Ohio and my dream job is to be a software developer.
I am taking a coding class and learning the basic on code. I have decided to make a clicker game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This will be a brainrot game based off of Skibidi Toilet but as a clicker game. 
I hope you enjoy this game as it took me a while to make it. 

I currently don't have a computer to be coding on so its been really difficult. 
This is currently being typed on an XBOX Series S using Microsoft Edge.
